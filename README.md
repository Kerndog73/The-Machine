# The Machine
A 2D box pushing game with some Minecraft Redstone mechanics

## Building

This game depends on a few of my other projects.

 * [Spritesheet packer](https://github.com/Kerndog73/Texture-Atlas-Generator)
 * [Simpleton](https://github.com/Kerndog73/Simpleton-Engine)
 * [Surface](https://github.com/Kerndog73/Surface)

They're all Xcode projects with install scripts built in so all you have to do is open the projects and build them. Spritesheet packer depends on surface so you'll have to build surface first.
