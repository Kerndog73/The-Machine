Make the player think a few steps ahead
	Make the player think about the consequinces of their actions and how they
  will affect them at a later step
Make the player hold a lot of possibilities in their head
	The player is presented with a number of choices, one of them is correct.
	The Player must think about all of the choices to find out which is correct
Make the player think about multiple things across different time frames
	A combination lock is short term because when the player is at the combo lock,
	they can solve it right then and there. But a box could be long term. Perhaps
  the box should not be moved when the player first encourters it but should be
  moved later in a way that links to the rest of the puzzle.
Sequencing
	The player must perform an action at the right time. Perhaps performing the
  action at the wrong time will put the level into an impossible state or simply
  won't work
Tricking the player
	Make the correct sequence seem more efficient. Put a switch close to the
  player, the player may think that it is more efficient to toggle the switch
  while right next to it. But toggling the switch at this point is the wrong
  move.
Layout
	Start with the general layout of the path the player must take and then build
	complexity onto this layout
